Uploaded Ver 2 includes the mountain and some trees, working on making the path walkable because the
character has to jump up parts of it. Trees need to be denser around perimeter so players cant fall 
off the map hehe oops.

Uploaded Ver 3 - Includes world models in the assets to be arranged on the map

Ver 6 - Includes all models except slide placed into the map and the lake created.
Need to remodel slide wont import right and I cant fix it :(
when player enters lake itll make screen blurry
box colliders on the house to minimize clipping inside it

Ignore the cave I have to fix this lol
